# DataflowTroubleshooting

This project is for explaining the different kinds of errors faced in mapping dataflows in Azure. Also, I would like to showcase my knowledge about dataflows. I base my understanding from my experience working for the ADF team. 

There are two main categories of errors in Azure, UserErrors and SystemErrors. I have created two different .txt files for each categories. However for user errors sometimes it is not correct categorization, as outages can also create usererrors.

There is of course excellent resources or docs explaining the troubleshooting, however i wanted to give my perspective from my experience
