# DataflowTroubleshooting

This project is for explaining the different kinds of errors faced in mapping dataflows in Azure. I base my understanding from my experience working for the ADF team. 

There are two main categories of errors in Azure, UserErrors and SystemErrors. I have created two different .txt files for each categories. However for user errors sometimes it is not correct categorization, as outages can also create usererrors.
